## First steps

Before using the functions in this module, you need to install and import the `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication` module, which is used for authenticating to the Graph API.

```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication
```

You also need to authenticate to the Graph API using the `Connect-MgGraph` cmdlet. This needs to be done in the same session where you plan to use the `AzureApiUtils` functions.

```powershell
Connect-MgGraph
```
